I'm becoming familiar with Git.

# Exercises

1. **Git basics and GitHub setup** 
  Learn the Git basics and set up an account on GitHub if you do not
  already have one. Practice the tips on Git in the notes. By going
  through the following tasks, ensure your repo has at least 10
  commits, each with an informative message. Regularly check the
  status of your repo using `git status`. The specific tasks are:
    1. Clone the repo to an appropriate folder on your computer.
    1. On your computer, add a file called `learningGit.md` to your
       repo; use Markdown syntax to fill it with the text of the
       [documentation on Git/GitHub resources](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/git-and-github-learning-resources).
    1. Play with `git commit` (save): add some a new section 
    `Personal	Notes` to describe your own learning
    experience. Experiment with commits such as:
	add new lines;	introduce some typos; correct the typo; etc. 
	Make sure you have informative commit messages.
	1. Use `git diff` to view the difference between two commits and
       appreciate the linewidth recommendation.
    1. "Push" your changes to GitHub.
    1. Make a change to your file on GitHub and commit.
    1. "Pull" the changes to your local computer.
    1. Create a "branch" (version), make a change, commit the change.
    1. Open a "pull request" (propose changes to the main branch)
	1. "Merge" your branch to the main branch.

  Git will keep track of all your changes. Use the command line to do
  the exercises. My grader will check the commit history.
